Once the files are loaded, you can simulate the robot on the 3D Field. To do so,
 1. Drag `AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Swerve/Odemtry Pose3d` to 3D Poses, and set it _Robot_
 2. Drag `AdvantageKit/RealOutputs/Mechanism3d` to 3D Poses, and set it to _Component(Robot)_
 3. Set the `Robot` under `Config` to _Rainbow Dash_
